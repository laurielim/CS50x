# CS50: Final Project - PoMa

PoMa is a web-based pomodoro timer.

## Background

As I was going through CS50, I realised that I spent hours without taking a break. During that time, I came across the pomodoro technique. Even though there are already plenty of apps that help implement it, I wanted to try making my own for my final project.

PoMa is short for Pomodoro Manager. It also means apple in Catalan. Despite the name, this web app is a simply timer right now. When I first thought of my final project, I wanted to create an app that allowed the user to create a to-do list and set pomodoros for each tasks. However, as I started working on it I realised that I didn't have the knowledge yet to bring my full idea to life.

One of the best things I've learnt so far is how to break down problems. Which is what I did in this case. I wrote down all the different elements I want in my app and grouped them into parts. For the first version of PoMa, I used what I learnt through the web track of CS50. As I learn more about web development, I intend on working on the other parts of PoMa until I have a full version of the app.

## Useage

When you open the app, you will be prompted to Login. If you do not have an account, you may Register.

You will notice a toggle switch on the upper right of the screen. This is the light switch. Dark mode is set by default but you may switch to the light mode if you wish.

Once logged in, you will see the countdown timer. The default timer is set to 25 minutes.

Press the start button to start the countdown timer. Once the timer has reached 0, a notification sound will ring to notify the user.

The countdown timer will then reset. If the user presses the stop button before the countdown timer reaches 0, the timer will also reset.

In the navigation bar, you may click on settings. On the settings page, you may change the notification sound and the number of minutes for the timer.

You must press the save button to save your changes. After clicking on save, you will be redirected to the timer.

If you go on the settings page once more, you will see the settings you set. Same goes for if you log out and log back in.
